# About The Project 
The Indonesian tourism industry has seen remarkable growth, but many tourists still struggle to find comprehensive information and experiences about tourist attractions in the
country. To address this challenge, we developed Tourify, a Tourism Application that offers
tour guide services and personalized recommendations for vacation spots in Indonesia.

With Tourify, tourists can now easily plan their trips and explore the best tourist attractions
in the country.
Additionally, Tourify has the potential to help promote Indonesian tourism and generate
economic benefits for local communities. By assisting tour guides in finding work and
creating more jobs, Tourify can also benefit local people who rely on the tourism industry.

Tourify is a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of finding information and
holiday experiences in Indonesia. We strongly believe that our application can make a
positive impact on Indonesian tourism by providing valuable services for both tourists and
local communities.
